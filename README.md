## üöÄ Project: Real-Time Dynamic Parking Pricing using Pathway

This capstone implements a **real-time data streaming pipeline** to dynamically compute parking prices based on live occupancy data, leveraging **Pathway** for stream processing and **Bokeh** for visualization.

It demonstrates:
- **Live data ingestion and streaming using Pathway**
- **Feature engineering** on streaming data for advanced pricing
- **Dynamic pricing based on utilization, demand fluctuation, peak hours, and surge pricing**
- **Live visualization** of pricing signals using interactive dashboards

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11+**
- **Pathway** (real-time data streaming and windowing)
- **Pandas** (initial preprocessing)
- **Bokeh** + **Panel** (interactive visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (development and demonstration)
- **Git + GitHub** (version control and submission)

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Architecture and Workflow

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion:**
- CSV file simulating parking spot occupancy over time
- Loaded using `pd.read_csv` and streamed using `pw.demo.replay_csv`

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing:**
- Combine `Date` and `Time` into `Timestamp`
- Sort chronologically

**3Ô∏è‚É£ Pathway Streaming Pipeline:**
- Define `ParkingSchema`
- Stream the data using `replay_csv`
- Parse timestamps and extract day and hour features
- Apply **daily tumbling windows** for aggregation
- Compute `occ_max`, `occ_min`, and `capacity` per day

**4Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Pricing Model:**
- Base price of 5
- Add demand fluctuation scaled by 10
- +2 during peak hours (8 AM - 6 PM)
- Apply a surge multiplier of 1.5 if utilization > 80%
- Compute and round final price dynamically in the stream

**5Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization:**
- Use Bokeh to generate an interactive plot
- View real-time streaming price signals

**6Ô∏è‚É£ Execution:**
- Run `pw.run()` to execute the real-time pipeline in the background
- Observe latency and progress in Pathway's dashboard
- Interact with the live Bokeh plot served using Panel
